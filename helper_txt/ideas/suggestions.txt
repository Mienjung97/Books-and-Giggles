General ideas



Mentor questions:

- What is the MVP? -> customized the poducts model, does that count as one of the three?

- Plan: Work along Walkthrough -> change general looks later when project is "finished" (how much difference in header and colors is recommended)

- Check out project board with Moscow and Epics - do I need sprints, do the Moscow principles be changed?

- "ISBN" model - is it wrong since I wrote it in all capital letters? It seems to work at the moment tho

- For deployment: Just basic or including all the steps until stripe, gmail and mail sending?

- JSONs okay? -> Plan: When creating real datbase, I would like to have all fixtures done to include all books, Authors, Categories, cover types
              -> name and friendly_name: "erichmariaremarque" or "erich_maria_remarque"? or just name?

- authors.json -> make Category?/Authors page: like product page, but just shows all authors -> or would that be double since you can sort all products with authors
               -> "About the author"
               
- products.json -> how many products? I thought 25 - 30 
                -> have links to the actual page in the JSON without using or put in documentation (directly in a readme section or as a txt file in readme folder for media)

- idea: fork project to create models and see if they work, so I do not mess up the actual project -> good idea?

- on product detail page, have a link to goodreads? Maybe even one additional model to include a goodreads comment?

- 2 or 3 "Description" areas on detail page -> e.g. "Good to know", "Additional infos", "Reading advice", "We would reccomend also" or "For whom is the book meant"?













3 custom models:
- FaQ
- Contact form on about page (like PP4 walkthrough)
- Discount -> Buy 5 books, get the cheapest for free




Home page:
- Home page carrusell with user story points

Detail page:
- 2 or 3 "Description" areas on detail page -> e.g. "Good to know", "Additional infos", "Reading advice", "We would reccomend also", "You could watch after reading" or "For whom is the book meant"? 
                                            -> make it like categories so the admin can decide which one it should be when adding products -> or just as text in the decription/side box?
- Goodreads area?
- Page count?
