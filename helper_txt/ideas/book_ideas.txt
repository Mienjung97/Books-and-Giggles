The only thing I'd append to this is that this series assumes that you know at least the basics about the setting (what Astartes are, what a Primarch is,
what the legions were founded to do, etc)

It's one of the best bits of 40k fiction out there, but it's not necessarily the best place to start if you're completely new to the setting.

THIS. Night Lords Omnibus is the absolute best thing you can read, but if you're just starting out, I recommend reading The First Heretic,
as it gives a ton of background on Erebus and the beginnings of the Warmaster's betrayal of the Emperor.
Then you can read Horus Rising, False Gods, Galaxy in Flames, and Flight of the Eisenstein in that order.
That will give you all the background you need to pick whatever else you feel like exploring based on author or faction.
