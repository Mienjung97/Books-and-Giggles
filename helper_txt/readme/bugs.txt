10.10.24: Cloned my project to another private repo to try out models and products fixtures (to not create problems in real repo) -> Had issues with the database and migrations -> with tutor support I was able to delete the db and implement the new models and test fixtures
17.10.24: after the clone, I had a copy of my project in my project -> deleted it after research on if that would create problems in the project
18.10.24: For search queries, since author and category are own models, the search didnt work -> included classes in the view with name and friendly name -> this gave duplicate resulats, therefore distinct() function was added to new "products" variable
04.11.24: When trying to edit a product, the edit author page appears. URLs seem to be correct -> URL mistake -> Done 05.11.2024

JS code: change targeted IDs to target classes -> change "#" to "." to target classes - does not work at the moment -> will be targeted
-> 30.10.24
!important:
Fix for the minus button in checkout once you finished the code for the quantity form:
in the form, all 3 ids have to be taken completely and put into the corresponding class element. 2 Buttons: increment and decrement and the input group
in the quantity_input_script.html, nested in the products includes folder, in the first function, all three "#" have to be changed to a "."



19.10.24: Sorting after category -> shows more products than in the store (duplicate books) -> will tackle later

23.10.24: Stripe will not work as intended - will fix tomorrow -> in webhook_handler I renamed "shopping_bag" to "bag" while getting the metadata, but set the following variables as "shopping_bag" -> name error -> fixed the code, had issues with the email sending, commented this part out for later -> code works as intended (24.10.24)

friendly name -> while writing the json, it would not take authors and categories with spaces and special charaters -> friendly_name was kept -> in admin panel, name can be changed to anything -> possible fix in future!

if the user changes the quantity to 0, 0 amount of items will be ordered, but it will still show up in the order summary and confirmation mail as "0x book"

I want to make author friendly_name mandatory for added models -> make friendls_name nullable, then run "python3 manage.py makemigrations products --empty" -> migrate by hand. 









Unsolved: If user clicks fast on "add to bad" button, the item will be added multiple times
