10.10.24: Cloned my project to another private repo to try out models and products fixtures (to not create problems in real repo) -> Had issues with the database and migrations -> with tutor support I was able to delete the db and implement the new models and test fixtures
17.10.24: after the clone, I had a copy of my project in my project -> deleted it after research on if that would create problems in the project
18.10.24: For search queries, since author and category are own models, the search didnt work -> included classes in the view with name and friendly name -> this gave duplicate resulats, therefore distinct() function was added to new "products" variable




19.10.24: Sorting after category -> shows more products than in the store (duplicate books) -> will tackle later

23.10.24: Stripe will not work as intended - will fix tomorrow -> in webhook_handler I renamed "shopping_bag" to "bag" while getting the metadata, but set the following variables as "shopping_bag" -> name error -> fixed the code, had issues with the email sending, commented this part out for later -> code works as intended (24.10.24)

friendly name -> while writing the json, it would not take authors and categories with spaces and special charaters -> friendly_name was kept -> in admin panel, name can be changed to anything -> possible fix in future!

if the user changes the quantity to 0, 0 amount of items will be ordered, but it will still show up in the order summary and confirmation mail as "0x book"
