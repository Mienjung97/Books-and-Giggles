10.10.24: Cloned my project to another private repo to try out models and products fixtures (to not create problems in real repo) -> Had issues with the database and migrations -> with tutor support I was able to delete the db and implement the new models and test fixtures
17.10.24: after the clone, I had a copy of my project in my project -> deleted it after research on if that would create problems in the project
18.10.24: For search queries, since author and category are own models, the search didnt work -> included classes in the view with name and friendly name -> this gave duplicate resulats, therefore distinct() function was added to new "products" variable
04.11.24: When trying to edit a product, the edit author page appears. URLs seem to be correct -> URL mistake -> Done 05.11.2024
I want to make author friendly_name mandatory for added models -> make friendls_name nullable, then run "python3 manage.py makemigrations products --empty" -> migrate by hand. Damn.... gotta do -> Done 09.11.2024
19.10.24: Sorting after category -> shows more products than in the store (duplicate books) -> will tackle later -> Deleted sorting option

JS code: change targeted IDs to target classes -> change "#" to "." to target classes - does not work at the moment -> will be targeted -> 30.10.24
Fix:
    Fix for the minus button in checkout once you finished the code for the quantity form:
    in the form, all 3 ids have to be taken completely and put into the corresponding class element. 2 Buttons: increment and decrement and the input group
    in the quantity_input_script.html, nested in the products includes folder, in the first function, all three "#" have to be changed to a "."

LMS Boutique Ado Bugs: 
- mobile-top-header throws HTML errors: li item is child of menu item. -> Add an ul tag with corresponding classes (Tutor support helped)
- HTML validator: Element p not allowed as child of element strong in this context. -> custom_clearable_file_input has that set up. Solution: removed "<strong></strong>"
- SAME DAMN FILE: Error: Bad value auto !important for attribute width on element img: Expected a digit but saw a instead. -> added a <div> between <a> and <img>


23.10.24: Stripe will not work as intended - will fix tomorrow -> in webhook_handler I renamed "shopping_bag" to "bag" while getting the metadata, but set the following variables as "shopping_bag" -> name error -> fixed the code, had issues with the email sending, commented this part out for later -> code works as intended (24.10.24)

friendly name -> while writing the json, it would not take authors and categories with spaces and special charaters -> friendly_name was kept -> in admin panel, name can be changed to anything -> possible fix in future!

if the user changes the quantity to 0, 0 amount of items will be ordered, but it will still show up in the order summary and confirmation mail as "0x book"


In the add_product page, the borders are not round -> wont fix yet



migration - nullable to be non nullable: With AI and tutor support solved:
    AI's take: Step 1: Add a default value
    First, add a default value to the field you want to make non-nullable. This ensures that existing NULL values have a valid replacement:
    Step 2: Populate existing NULL values
    Create a data migration to populate any existing NULL values with the default value:
    Create an empty migration:
    Edit the new migration file to include a function that updates NULL values:
    Apply this migration.
    Step 3: Remove null=True
    Now that all NULL values have been replaced, you can remove null=True from your model field:
    Generate and apply migrations for this change.
    Step 4: Remove the default value (optional)



Unsolved: If user clicks fast on "add to bad" button, the item will be added multiple times
