# Project

## Objective
The idea of creating an online book store came to me from multiple angles - I am not an avid reader, nor do I own a lot of books (most of them are featured on this website) - but there is a deep connection on why I choose to make this my final project for the Code Institute Full Stack Software Developer course: My grandparents were both really into books, my grandmother loved the Angelique series, as well as many other historical fiction books, my grandfather has always enjoyed any kind of illustraded books, mostly of nature, mountains and animals. Unfortunatly, my grandfather passed in July and my grnadmother shortly after starting the project. My partner is also an avid reader, who suggested the idea to me - so I decided to create this project in memory of my grandparents and in dedication to my mother, partner and all the "book worms" in my family. Most of the books featured on this page are owend and were reccomended by them.

### Site Users Goal
Site users can browse through the webpage to gain inspiration for their next book or book series, as well as about the authors themselves. The website is easy to navigate and has an easy checkout procedure. Any user can contact the sites admin for questions, issues or ideas, as well as subscribing to the "Books and Giggles Newsletter" to stay up to date with inventory, promotions and sales. On the about page, the user can learn about the  and all possible questions are answered on the FAQ page. It is easy to create a profile, so that the user can save their information for their next purchaise and keep track of previous orders, but the creation of a profile is not necessary to order.

### Site Owners Goal
Besides providing a fully functional and welcoming E-commerce book store, the admin can modify all important data either via frontend implementation, like adding, editing or deleting products, authors and FAQ items, or through the admin panel, like changing the about page or editing categories. Any contact request will be send to the admin panel, providing important information like name and email. The admin can keep track of orders and collects payment info via [stripe](https://stripe.com) and collects the email addresses on [brevo](https://www.brevo.com/) with the option to send out customized newsletters. More information about all [features](<#existing-features>) and the [future features](<#future-features>) are below.

[Back to top](<#table-of-content>)

## Business Model
Books and Giggles is a Business to Consumer (B2C) E-commerce platform that sells books to everyone. The store has both low priced books for all ages, in addition classics, contemporary books to dystopian sience fiction and true stories about war. Also the store sells a high priced book, intended for collectors.

While providing everything a readers heart could wish for, Books and Giggles encourages their users to interact with the sites owners to make sure the store lives up to its potential. The philosophy behind the store is to be as accommodating for its users as possible. Customer support is an integral part of the business to rather have a smaller, but loyal customer base than to try and focus to become the biggest book store. 

More information about how this would be possible are in the [future features](<#future-features>) section.

## Marketing Techniques
After doing the callanges from the LMS, I have decided to implement good SEO as well as getting the e-mail marketing in form of the newsletter the main objective. If the website would be an actual E-commerce webpage, I would start by doing social media marketing by myself, as well as paying for targeted social media ads on Facebook and Instagram, as well as Sponsored posts with book influencers on various platforms like TikTok, Instagram and more. For more information, visit the last section of the marketing challange below.

## Project Management

### Github Board
For organizing and planning my project, I have used the [Github board](https://github.com/users/Mienjung97/projects/9/views/1), which has helped me a lot with planning out and fulfilling the acceptance criterias. I have thoroughly kept the user stories up to date with the coding progress. Additionally, I have used multiple .txt files to keep up with ideas, documentation, my mentor meetings and bugs to implement in this documentation. 

<details><summary><b>Github Board</b></summary>

## Database Schema


The database schema was created with [BugBytes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzrE7cfc_3Q&t=478s) YouTube video and the corresponding tool [dreampuf](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/). Due to health issues I could not completely follow my time plan, therefore I was unable to create a database schema myself, which was planned to be done with [Lucid](https://lucid.app/documents#/home?folder_id=recent).

* **Product** - Handles all products
* **Author** - Handles all authors - connected to the product model
* **Categories** - Handles all categories - connected to the product model
* **Cover** - Handles the cover types available - connected to the product model
* **Order** - Handles all orders
* **OrderLineItem** - Handler between the products and a users order for checkout
* **Profile** - Handles the user profile information (full name, delivery information and order history for the specific user). There is a one-to-one relation to the user model to connect it to the standard user model.
* **About** - Handles the about information provided through the admin panel
* **FAQ** - Handles all frequently asked questions
* **Contact** - Handles all contact requests and sends them to the admin panel
* **All-Auth** - Various models included due to all-auth that handle users, email addresses and more

# User Experience (UX)

## Wireframes
The wireframes for the site were created in the software [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). The wireframes have been created for desktop, tablet and mobile devices. The text content wasn't finalized during the wireframe process. Also I have decided to only focus on the user side since the admin frontend capabilities are less important for styling.

## Site Structure

Books and Giggles has been designed so that any user can access every feature without having a profile (User profile and order history excluded), including ordering. The website also has been structured so that every feature works on all screen sizes. 

When a user enters the site, the header has all navigation elements and the body displays a simple text and a caroussel, each redirecting the user towards the corresponding product page. The user can also access every books detail page or get information about the authors on the "Authors" page.

The admin has multiple front end admin capabilities, like adding, editing or deleting products, authors and FAQ items, as well as adding categories. Through the admin panel to which a superuser has a direct button, every other functionality, like recieving the contact requests, is available. 

## Design Choices

### Color Scheme
The color scheme, as well as the styling ideas were developed while coding to mimic the colors of books, paper and bindings

[Coolors](https://coolors.co/) was used to create the color palette:

<details><summary><b>Color Palette</b></summary>
<br>
<br>

![Color Palette image](readme/assets/images/colors.PNG)

[Back to top](<#table-of-content>)

</details><br/>

### Typography
The fonts used for the site are 'Playfair Display'. Fallback font is sans-serif.

'Playfair Display' is used on the whole webpage. Choosing this font family was because I thought it would fit the theme.

<details><summary><b>Playfair Display</b></summary>

# Features

## Existing Features

### Navigation
The styling of the navigation bar was heavily influenced by the [Boutique ADO](https://boutique-ado-mj-102bd7708d45.herokuapp.com/) walkthough website, while I tried to keep it as clean as possible. The only differences are between Admins and any other users - in addition to the usual navigation, the admin also has a "Product Management" option in the profile dropdown.

The following is devided into mobile and desktop views, showing how each individual dropdown menu looks according to the screen size:

<details><summary><b>Navigation Large</b></summary>

## E-commerce Features

<details><summary><b>Open</b></summary>

### Shopping Bag
The shopping bag does exactly what a shopping bag should do: You can add and remove items, as well as adjusting the quantity of each item in the bag. The bag displays the nessesary information about the product or products the user would like to purchase like name, picture and price. Depending on mobile or desktop view, the layout is a bit different, to make the process to the checkout page as easy as possible. The shopping bag also informs the user about delivery costs or if the minimum for free delivery has been reached.

## Confirmation Features

<details><summary><b>Open</b></summary>

### Pop Up Messages
There are a variety of different Pop Up messages - depending on what the user (or admin) wants to do, most functionalities are connected to a notification. In general, there are different types of messages:

* Success messages: any action the user does which requires a positive feedback, like adding items to the cart, logging in or an admin updates the database successfully
* Info messages: mostly admin related, which informs about editing the database, or when a user clicks a past oder summary
* Warning message: for endusers, this only appears when the stripe public key is missing - the admin will be presented with this message if they want to delete a product or author
* Error message: this message either informs the user about an error that occured, or if a normal user tries to use an admin path
* Newsletter error message: if the user enters an invalid email format, an error message will appear
* Newsletter success message: if the user subscribes to the newsletter, a success message will appear

Site note: the admin success messages look different than for the users: users only get success confirmation for interacting with the store, so they will be shown a summary of their shopping bag, while the admin does not get the preview (reason: the admin gets success messages more frequently and usually does not shop in their own store).

Below you can see some examples, more are in this [folder](readme/assets/images/features/msg/).

</details><br/>

### Delete FAQ
Deleting an FAQ item is the only front end delete option that does not have its own confirmation page, just a "Delete" button. The reason for this is that deleting an FAQ item vy accident, it only has a small impact on the website and can be re implemented quite easy. Deleting an author or a product would have bigger consequences, therefore they have the delete page.

<details><summary><b>Delete FAQ</b></summary>

</details><br/>


### Admin Panel
On the admin panel, an admin can access all profiles, email addresses, order, products and every other model. Everything has full CRUD functionality, so all features that do not have a corresponding front end page can be modified here.

## Future Features

### Marketing

* For a live website, future features include all the marketing ideas I came up with in in the marketing challange
* An extension of the newsletter: Besides only getting a confirmation email, I would implement another email, timed possibly 24 hours after signing up, giving some sort of discount to make the user come back to the page. Also a bi-weekly or monthly newsletter should be implemented

### Features

* Admin capability: Responding to contact requests via the website

## Testing User Stories

## Code Validation
The code on the 'Books and Giggles' site has been tested through W3C Markup Validation Service, W3C CSS Validation Service, JSHint and the CodeInstutute pep8 validator. A few errors were found the W3C Markup Validation Service but could either be quite easily fixed (see bugs section) or have to do with third party code, especially Stripe, AWS and Brevo. 

### Markup Validation
While validating the HTML code, I encountered only a few errors. Since the Markup validator is not an admin user, I could only validate the pages availabe for endusers via url input - so with use of the chrome developer tools I validated every admin related page via direct input. The only errors that came up are due to third party code. Proof for all validations are in this [folder](readme/assets/images/validation/html). From my previous project, I know that summernote, wich I use for the "About" page, can throw "font element" errors, which might not be included since I have not updated the content on the "About" page yet.

The following shows some validations, especially the ones that had an error:


<details><summary><b>HTML Validation URL input</b></summary>

Password Change (Errors):

![HTML Result Password Change](readme/assets/images/validation/html/pw_change_html_val.PNG)

</details><br/>

[Back to top](<#table-of-content>)

### CSS Validaton
When validating my own code the W3C CSS Validator reports no errors. The only errors shown are via url input, which have to do with the third party newsletter provider

</details><br/>

[Back to top](<#table-of-content>)

### PEP Validation
To validate the python files, I have used the [pep8 CodeInstitute linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) I have tested all python files in my project without getting any errors. The documentation can be found in the [folder](readme/assets/images/validation/python). Every picture is labled with the first word as the corresponding app and the name of the python file. 45 out of the 47 files reported no error - just the webhook.py file in the checkout app, as well as in the settings the "AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS" were longer than 79 lines. Both files have been fixed.

[Back to top](<#table-of-content>)

### JavaScript Validation
The JSHint validator results can be seen below, only 3 files are shown. the rest of the validation can be found in this [folder](readme/assets/images/validation/static/js)

No errors were returned when passing through JSHint, the tests reported undefined variables and gave out a total of 8 warnings. None of these are problematic.

## Additional Testing

### Manual Testing

### Responsiveness Test
The responsive design tests were carried out manually with [Google Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) and [Multi Device Mockup Generator](https://techsini.com/multi-mockup/).

### Browser Compatibility
* Google Chrome Version (version 128.0.6613.119)
* Mozilla Firefox (version 127.0 )
* Microsoft Edge (version 128.0.2739.54)

[Back to top](<#table-of-content>)

### Lighthouse
Google Lighthouse in Chrome Developer Tools was used to test the application within the areas of *Performance*, *Accessibility*, *Best Practices* and *SEO*. 

The test results have been mostly positive, besides the performance score (between x and y), as well as accessibility. The latter one has especially on the desktop version (all pages) and the shopping bag and product detail page issues, since there are labels missing for most buttons. I decided that this is not an issue for now since the products are not meant for the visually impaired. In the future features, I do want to implement these as well so that the page is also accessable for the visually impaired, so that they are also able to shop for books as e.g. gifts. 

I have tested every page from Books and Giggles with lighthouse, every picture can be found in this [folder](readme/assets/images/validation/lighthouse)

[Back to top](<#table-of-content>)

### Peer Review
Additional testing of the application was conducted by people outside of the software development field by friends and family. No errors and no issues with design or handling of the site were found. Also my webpage has been tested by fellow Code Insititute students Marcellio and Jan with the same result.
