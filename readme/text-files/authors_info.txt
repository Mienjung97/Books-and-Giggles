His landmark novel All Quiet on the Western Front (1928), based on his experience in the Imperial German Army during World War I,
was an international bestseller which created a new literary genre of veterans writing about conflict.
The book was adapted to film several times. Remarque's anti-war themes led to his condemnation by Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels as "unpatriotic". 
He was able to use his literary success and fame to relocate to Switzerland as a refugee, and to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen.
